# AsyncRL_CPP
C++ library for designing and implementing asynchronous reinforcement learning frameworks.

## Project Status
**Current Phase:** Early Development

- **Implemented:**
  - basic project structure
  - intitial testing framework
  - select core components:
    - classes: Actor, RandomEngine
    - template classes: FunctionApproximator, Policy
- **In progress:**
  - further core components
  - classes: ActorFactory, Learner, GradientCalculator, RolloutManager, ReplayBuffer
- **Planned:**
  - Complete out-of-the-box RL algorithms (A3C, Parallel DQN, etc.)
  - documentation and examples for creating custom algorithms
  - Report generator and logger
  - Error tracer and execution monitor
  - installation and basic usage guides.
