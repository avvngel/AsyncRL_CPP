# AsyncRL_CPP
C++ library for designing and implementing asynchronous reinforcement learning frameworks.

## Project Status
**Current Phase:** Early Development

- **Implemented:**
  - Basic project structure
  - Intitial testing framework
  - Select core components:
    - Classes: Actor, RandomEngine
    - Template classes: FunctionApproximator, Policy
- **In progress:**
  - Further core components
    - Classes: ActorFactory, Learner, GradientCalculator, RolloutManager, ReplayBuffer
- **Planned:**
  - Support for multi-dimensional action spaces (currently limited to 1D)
  - Complete out-of-the-box RL algorithms (A3C, Parallel DQN, etc.)
  - Documentation and examples for creating custom algorithms
  - Report generation and logging system
  - Error tracer and execution monitor
  - Installation and basic usage guides
