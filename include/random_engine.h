/**
 * @brief A utility class for managing global random number generation with optional seeding.
 *
 * The RandomEngine class provides a mechanism for setting a global seed to ensure
 * reproducibility across all random number generators used within the library. By 
 * default, the random engine is unseeded, producing non-deterministic random sequences 
 * because the random number generators (RNGs) returned by this class are seeded with a 
 * non-deterministic sequence of seeds. Once a seed is set, a seed generator produces a 
 * deterministic sequence of seeds, ensuring that the RNGs returned will produce 
 * deterministic sequences of numbers across runs.
